# LimaCharlie Sensor Container

![LimaCharlie Logo](https://storage.googleapis.com/limacharlie-io/logo_glitch.gif)

## What is LimaCharlie?
LimaCharlie is a Security Infrastructure as a Service platform.

The foundational technology used by LimaCharlie is a cross platform EDR.

## What is this container used for?

### Container
This container is designed to run the LimaCharlie EDR in a privileged
container as part of Docker-based cluster environments like Kubernetes.

The deployed EDR gives you visibility, and logging of all the container's activity
as well as the ability to perform investigations and mitigation.

### Network Tap
This container is designed to receive packets from a source like a span port. It will
capture inbound packets and send them to LimaCharlie in batches. This can be used
to create a passive network tap.

## Basic Usage

### Container
This assumes you have an Organization created on LimaCharlie.io (free account and free tier available).

On LimaCharlie.io create an Installation Key and copy it to your clipboard.

On a host of your cluster (although you can still run the sensor on a normal Docker install), start
the container like this (replacing `<<<your_key>>>` with the installation key value):

```
docker run --privileged --net=host -v /:/rootfs:ro -v /var/run/docker/netns:/netns:ro --env HOST_FS=/rootfs --env NET_NS=/netns --env LC_INSTALLATION_KEY=<<<your_key>>> refractionpoint/limacharlie_sensor
```

That's it! You should see your sensor pop-up in your LimaCharlie Organization.

### Network Tap
Just create the container and point packets to it. The following environment variables
can be used to customize the behavior:

* `OID`: LimaCharlie Organization ID
* `TOKEN`: LimaCharlie Ingestion Token
* `TAP_NAME`: (optional, default lc_tap) Name to identity as a source of the pcap
* `RETENTION`:(optional, default 7) Number of days to retain the pcap in LimaCharlie
* `INTERFACE`: Name of the network interface to capture from
